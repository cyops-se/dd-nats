# [CYOPS-SE dd-opcda UI](https://github.com/cyops-se/dd-opcda/ui)
User interface to the dd-opcda application based on the excellent [Vuetify Material Dashboard Free](https://store.vuetifyjs.com/products/vuetify-material-dashboard-free).


## Getting Started
*Please read the original [README](./ORIGINAL.md) for more details.*

- Install Nodejs from the official [Nodejs page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install yarn from the official [Yarn installation page](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable).
- Open your terminal
- Navigate to the project
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn serve` to start a local development server
- A new tab will be opened in your browser

You can also run additional tasks such as

- `yarn run build` to build your app for production
- `yarn run lint` to run linting.

Once you have build for production, the result files are stored in the 'dist' directory. Copy the content to the 'static' directory in the main dd-opcda directory before building the [dd-opcda](../README.md) application
